<p><B>Snowboarding</B><p>

<P>One of my favorite hobbies is snowboarding. I do not enjoy winter and wish I lived somewhere we did not get snow but since that's not the case I figure I'll take advantage of the weather. I've been snowboarding for almost 8 years and go every winter.<P>

<p><B>Golf</B><p>

<P>My entire life I have been involved in golf. Both my parents and my brother have been golfing for most of their lives. I started to take golf seriously in freshman year and tried out for the golf team sophomore year and played for the varsity team the last three years of highschool.<P>
